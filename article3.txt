Indictment dropped against Rick Perry



Washington (CNN) The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on Wednesday dropped charges against Rick Perry that alleged the former Texas governor abused his power while in office.

Perry, a two-time former GOP presidential candidate, was indicted by a grand jury in August 2014 after he first threatened and then carried out a veto that defunded a statewide public integrity unit in an attempt to force a district attorney's resignation.

Perry originally faced two indictments, but one was dismissed by a lower court in July.

"Appeals court clears @GovernorPerry of all charges. Thank you for your thoughts and prayers. #StandWithRick," tweeted an official account manned by his staff.


The case examined the state's separation-of-power provision in the Texas Constitution and a governor's veto power under the "abuse of official capacity" statute.

Perry fought the indictment, claiming that the counts were "unconstitutional."

The dismissal supported this claim, stating, "public servants have a First Amendment right to engage in expression, even threats, regarding their official duties."

Perry served as the governor of Texas for 15 years, where he was the longest-serving governor in the history of the state.
